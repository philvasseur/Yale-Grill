# Yale Grill

Yale Grill is an iOS application that streamlines the grill ordering process at Yale Dining Halls.

Only usable by those with a valid Yale email address.

## Features

* Keeps track of and updates the orders in realtime using Google's Firebase Database.
* Uses Google/SignIn, allowing only students with Yale emails to access the app and place orders.
* Special accounts for the cooks allow them to see all orders, mark them as they finished, and delete them as they get picked up.
* Sends a push notificaiton to the student when their order is marked finished, lowering the amount of food waste from students forgetting to pick up their orders.
* Strikes are given if students don't pick up their order within a set amount of time, temporarily banning users from the app if they reach a set amount of strikes (which stops any possible griefing).
* Uses location services to automatically suggest the dining hall which you are closest to.
